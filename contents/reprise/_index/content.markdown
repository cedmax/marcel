The first study of Marcel has been called “Ready to tale, Fairy made”, and it has been performed as an installation, in the contest of Teatro Lo Spazio, Rome, in the Summer of 2012. In that occasion, Sara Brugnolo, the only performer, won the prize as Best Actress.

We’ve shown Marcel as a show to the Brighton Fringe, in May 2013
