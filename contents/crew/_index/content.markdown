## POINT DE FUITE - VANISHING POINT

[Cut the Moose](http://cutmoose.com) is a new collaboration founded by the director _Irene Ros_ and puppeteer _Helen Ainsworth_.
The collaboration is dedicated to creating thought provoking theatre that is visually stimulating, essentially entertaining and often surreal.

Ursa Maior Teatro (company) was born in 2002, from the intersection of the paths of Irene Ros and Briana Zaki, both coming from experimental theatre and from DAMS’ (Degree in Arts, Music and Spectacle, Bologna University) classrooms.

Since 2002 Ursa Maior has been created performances for children and for adults, trying to consolidate its own aesthetics, investigating new relationships between space and word, between word and body, respecting the path hidden in the scripts.
