# VOL. I &#8211; ITALIAN POLITICS AS A WORK OF ART

Marcel is a dada performance running on two tracks: one is the story of a man and a woman in an apocalyptic set (a long blackout populated by a strange army), a situation which makes people rethink about the concept of evolution; the other track (the characters’ nightmares) is a readymade, a script created from the interceptions from the “Ruby’s case”, which involves the Italian former Prime Minister Berlusconi and an underage Moroccan girl.

The aim is to change the readymade track time to time, using different cases taken as readymade from current events to illustrate the contemporary world through grotesque and absurd.
