_Point de fuite - Vanishing point_ is NOT another cheesy show about immigrants! "Vanishing Point" is a wicked cocktail of fiercely ironic performance laced with hilariously surreal buffoonery. The show investigates the way the European Media talks about immigration and puts our reaction in the spotlight. 

Developed and devised using current Media articles, the show deftly fuses puppetry, technology, an old Pierrot, physical humour, audience participation and a sharp view on today's world to make you sit up and think, as you laugh.

Marcel is a performance/installation inspired by Duchamp and “The Wizard of Oz”, (born in the recession of the late ‘800), crossing the concept of contemporary crisis, which forces us to re-invent, deconstruct, thing again to the world and re-use its wastes.

A crisis which allows wizards, good-natured poseurs and pretenders, to exist.

### ITALIAN POLITICS AS A WORK OF ART

_Italian Politics as a Work of Art_ is a dada performance running on two tracks: one is the story of a man and a woman in an apocalyptic set (a long blackout populated by a strange army), a situation which makes people rethink about the concept of evolution; the other track (the characters’ nightmares) is a readymade, a script created from the interceptions from the “Ruby’s case”, which involves the Italian former Prime Minister Berlusconi and an underage Moroccan girl.
