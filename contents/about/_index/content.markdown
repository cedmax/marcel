# VOL. I &#8211; ITALIAN POLITICS AS A WORK OF ART

Marcel is a dada performance running on two tracks: one is the story of a man and a woman in an apocalyptic set (a long blackout populated by a strange army), a situation which makes people rethink about the concept of evolution; the other track (the characters’ nightmares) is a readymade, a script created from the interceptions from the “Ruby’s case”, which involves the Italian former Prime Minister Berlusconi and an underage Moroccan girl.

The aim is to change the readymade track time to time, using different cases taken as readymade from current events to illustrate the contemporary world through grotesque and absurd.

Marcel wanted to be a performance/installation inspired by Duchamp and “The Wizard of Oz”, (born in the recession of the late ‘800), crossing the concept of contemporary crisis, which forces us to re-invent, deconstruct, thing again to the world and re-use its wastes.

A crisis which allows wizards, good-natured poseurs and pretenders, to exist.

We wanted to create an installation.

But Dadaism won the day and we started stuttering.

Da da da da.

Which is the shape of a dada performance?

Starting from a physical training we could build the performance on two layers: while the dialogs tell a story, our actions can tell another one.

Marcel is an attempt to create a dialog between theatre and contemporary world.

The readymade part of this first edition has been taken from the public document of the Court of Milan which formally required Silvio Berlusconi to appear before a judge for the famous “Ruby’s case”. It was actually a ready-made script we just had to cut down.

Marcel, however, is not a performance about Berlusconi. The Italian former Prime Minister and his politics are a mere means to talk about our reality.

Apart from the use of ready-made, the performance is permeated by images and themes from the dada movement: the stage is invaded by half-machine men and prostitutes, as in a post-war set.
