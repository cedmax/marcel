We wanted to create an installation.

But Dadaism won the day and we started stuttering.

Da da da da.

Which is the shape of a dada performance?

Starting from a physical training we could build the performance on two layers: while the dialogs tell a story, our actions can tell another one.

Marcel is an attempt to create a dialog between theatre and contemporary world.

The readymade part of this first edition has been taken from the public document of the Court of Milan which formally required Silvio Berlusconi to appear before a judge for the famous “Ruby’s case”. It was actually a ready-made script we just had to cut down.

Marcel, however, is not a performance about Berlusconi. The Italian former Prime Minister and his politics are a mere means to talk about our reality.

Apart from the use of ready-made, the performance is permeated by images and themes from the dada movement: the stage is invaded by half-machine men and prostitutes, as in a post-war set.
