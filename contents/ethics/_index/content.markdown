Art is politics, is a mirror of our society.

Theatre is great when it tells something more than what you can read in a script. That’s why theatre can be politics even if you’re playing Goldoni.

Marcel works on the opposite as a Goldoni: it doesn’t start from a classic to make it contemporary, but it tries to show the archetype of the contemporary history.

All the Italian contemporary history is based on the Italian national obsession, Mr Berlusconi (who has obsessed the international press as well), who was able to change through his  media the concepts of women, of success, of morality, of right and wrong. 

Theatre should lead the spectators to reflect, no matter how.

Theatre put together lots of different arts: a reflection can spring out from the script, from the movement, from the set design.
