## VOL. I
### ITALIAN POLITICS AS A WORK OF ART

Someone liked Marcel, someone didn't, but getting 4 reviews in 2 weeks is definitely meaningful.<br/><br/> -->

<blockquote class="main"> What I have in mind is that art may be bad, good or indifferent, but, whatever adjective is used, we must call it art, and bad art is still art in the same way that a bad emotion is still an emotion.<cite><a href="http://www.wisdomportal.com/Cinema-Machine/Duchamp-CreativeAct.html" target="_blank">Marcel Duchamp</a></cite> </blockquote>

<!-- ## Who liked it -->

<blockquote>The show manages to comment on political corruption, saturation of information, negative representations of women as well as parodying military rigmarole in a generally absurdist fashion.<cite><a href="http://www.broadwaybaby.com/shows/marcel/31824" target="_blank">Broadwaybaby</a></cite></blockquote>

<blockquote>Possibly the most eclectic and sideways commemoration of the First World War at the Fringe.

<blockquote class="main">The analyses that have been put forward are not necessarily of any value, since I have not offered any explanation myself.
